NPS stands for Net Promoter Score, which is a common metric used in customer experience programs. An NPS score measures customer loyalty by looking at their likelihood of recommending a given business.
In this project I audited the customer feedback comments to better understand what customers are expecting us to do & to assess overall customer loyalty, identified areas for improvement, or benchmark against competitors.Categorized all the comments using premade categories &; to leverage insights from NPS audit for better strategic changes to improve the customer service for the betterment of the company. 
Determined which customer segments will be surveyed (e.g., new customers, long-term customers, specific product users) & which factors most influence NPS scores (e.g., product quality, customer service, pricing) using exploratory data analysis.Used charts and graphs to make the data easy to understand and interpret. 
Based on the NPS analysis, identied the most critical areas where customer experience can be enhanced. Created detailed plans with clear steps & timelines for addressing identified issues.Regularly monitored the impact of implemented changes and made adjustments as needed.
Advocated the implementation of a Chatbot solution on Tinman (SAAS) driven by an in-depth NPS analysis, resulting in a significant 15% boost in Net Promoter Score while reducing customer churn rate by 20%.
